# ttW_run2

Package for study ttW process with full Run2 dataset.
Contains several projects:
 1. NtupleProduction - AnalysisTop based framework to process derivations
 2. FeasibilityStudy - feasibility study for measuring ttW production in a high-purity (but low-branching) channel
 3. AnalysisLoop - histogram production over output of the NtupleProduction
 4. RivetWttAnalysis - set of rivet routines:
        a. Validation of the AT based code ttW - multilepton final state, commonly distributed to CMS analysers
        b. Test of ttW W->qq and dileptonic tbar analysis, feasibility, test of mW window cut
