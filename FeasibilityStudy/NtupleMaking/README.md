Script and configs to make AnalysisTop n-tuples of some relevant samples.

These n-tuples select leptons of the flavour $$\ell\ell\ell'$$ ($$\ell$$ = $$e$$ or $$\mu$$). These may be particularly interesting for the possibly low-background signal channel

$$t\bar{t}W^{\pm} \to \ell^{\pm}\ell^{\pm}\ell'^{\mp} b \bar{b} \mbox{ + neutrinos}$$
